# 2023 Genuary Project

What better way to get back into the creative coding groove than follow along with Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code 2 playlist.

- Nature of Code 2 Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM
- NoC 1: https://natureofcode.com/

One way to do this would be the use the fabulous editors:
- https://p5js.org
- https://openprocessing.org/

The meat of much of this code already lives there in Coding Train accounts.

## Why all the HTML files?

p5js is web embeddable focused, so why not build this as a website?

I cd into the the directory that has this repo and do `python3 -m http.server` to navigate through it on my home computer.

Nice side effect, it's immediately available as a website.
