# 2023 Genuary Project

What better way to get back into the creative coding groove than follow along with Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code 2 playlist.

- Nature of Code 2 Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM
- NoC 1: https://natureofcode.com/

One way to do this would be the use the fabulous editors:
- https://p5js.org
- https://openprocessing.org/

I will likely move some of the more successful sketches over there, but much of this code already lives there, I'm following along with videos after all.
