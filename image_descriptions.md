Two separate dark gray rectangles side by side. One has a diffuse cloud of white dots, the other has what looks like a tangled thread of dots. In both a pink circle highlights some of the dots turning them green. 

On a dark background, a dense cluster of white points overlay a grid. There is a pink ring with a fizz of those white points encircled with cyan rings around its edge. There are no dots inside the circle. 

A mix of small black rings and white dots on a dark gray field scored with gridlines. There is a dark circular shadow with a fizz of white rings on the edge. There are no white dots or rings under the shadow. 

Screen shot of two digital sketches side by side, they use the same color palettes, etc. The one on the left renders a jagged circular shape, looking kind of like Antarctica. There are three sliders in the left hand corner in a box. Their lables and numbers don't really make sense. There are no sliders on the right hand sketch, and it looks more like a tissue paper flower. This is caused by several jagged Antarctica outlines stacked on each other. 

POST: Okay, first day with TypeScript set up in the repo... and I didn't use it! Doh. These sketches were too simple to bother. Did I get to play around with sliders... These sketches are based on Coding Challenge #136  

A mix of  tiny gray and cyan rings scattered across a dark gray field scored with gridlines. There are fewer cyan rings. All cyan rings are touching at least one other ring and the gray ones have no rings that they are touching.  Some squares of the grid are subdivided, some are not. 

On a light gray field, an orange and navy blue cocoon around a deep blue void.

Animation of three triangles braiding and weaving around the circumference of a circle that is not there. They leave a trail of their past selves in their wake: one red, one green, one blue. 

Three squares, each with a black and white amoebus pattern. The first is hardly anything beyond speckled dots. The second has a sponge like texture. The the third is more like the side of a cow. 

Grid of six light gray squares with black borders. Each square has a scene in it with pendulums anchored in the middle. The first is a single blue pendulum. The second contains 5 pendulums with assorted colors all anchored at the same point. The third has the same 5 pendulums but each linked to the other in kind of a jumble. The fourth is some kinda crazy yarn ball that coincidentally is the same colors as the previous pendulums. The last two are only gray-scale. The fifth looks like the pendulums swinging all in successive row from the top center instead of the middle like the others. The sixth moves back to the center put is in a snake like configuration.

Grid of six light gray squares with black borders. Each scene has blue and yellow figures illustrating the use of sine and cosine to create variable patters. There are circles and waves and dots and little lone blue roller on an unending hilly yellow terrain. 

Yellow disk cannot escape its dark blue spirograph tail. 

Screenshot of code. It is the main function of a file called make_all_for_day.py available in GitHub repo linked from this post. From the screen one might be able to tell that the code takes arguments for a day number and a directory. It then runs a handful of other scripts, not shown, based on that information. Tasks like generating a list of sketches, creating index pages, moving css files, etc. 

Screenshot of an HTML file. Normal basic stuff in muted colors punctuated by BRIGHT PINK wherever there is a variable name surrounded by curly braces led by a dollar sign.  

Lines with dots, lines with arrows, connecting, crisscrossing. A triangle with a proboscis, a triangle with solid fill...   and a thin swoop swirly white line. Who can even tell what is going on! 

9 squares embedded in a webpage, each with its own rules and colors and simple creatures that will never know they are in a square on a web page.
