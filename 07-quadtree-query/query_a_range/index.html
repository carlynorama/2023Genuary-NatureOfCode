    <p>So... FINALLY have something that looks like the sketch at the end of [Coding Challenge 98.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQx_NmCIuCY), [see shiffmans code](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/g7LnWQ42x)</p>
    <p>I took a slightly different approach, passing a function in rather than points out directly. p5js functions are being handed in to do the drawing this way. It could use some refactoring, but I'm walking away before I break it!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>draw static points</li>
      <li>qTree.doWithPoints(everyPointFunction);</li>
      <li>qTree.doWithPointsWithin(bounds, somePointsFunction);</li>
    </ol>
  </main>
</body>
