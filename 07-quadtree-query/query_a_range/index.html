    <p>So... FINALLY have something that looks like the sketch at the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQx_NmCIuCY">Coding Challenge 98.2</a>), <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/g7LnWQ42x">see video code</a></p>
    <p>I took a slightly different approach, passing a function in rather than points out. p5js functions are being handed in to do the drawing this way. It could use some refactoring, but I'm walking away before I break it!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get Every</li>
      <ul><li>qTree.doWithPoints(everyPointFunction): where everyPointFunction is a function that takes a point</li>
      <li>qTree.doWithSubTreeInfo(treeInfoHandler): where treeInfoHandler takes in a points array (from just a leaf),  the leaf's bounds, the leaf's level, quadrantPath to the leaf.</li>
      <li>qTree.doWithLeafBounds(boundsHandler): where boundsHandler takes in a leaf's bounds. </li></ul>
      <li>Response to Bounds Query</li>
      <ul><li>qTree.doWithPointsWithin(bounds, somePointsFunction): where bounds is the query range and somePointsFunction is a function that takes a point</li></ul>
    </ol>
