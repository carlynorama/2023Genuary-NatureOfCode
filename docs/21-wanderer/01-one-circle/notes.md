Skipping doing anything for the arrive video because I feel like I already explored that area with `approach` and `mainTaindistance` and the two skirting functions.

- `pursue` - give it a target and it will `seek` a number of paces ahead
- `evade` - give it a target and it will `flee` a number of paces ahead
