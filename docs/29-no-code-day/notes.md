For all the previous topics, between the examples and my own ideas, it was pretty easy to just make a little thing as a quicky. Today I didn't have an idea that immediately appealed to me that I could whack out in a day, but I did decide to stay steeped in the material by watching videos. Also I have a cold. So does the cat. "Watched" might have been more "slept while listening to."

### Chapter 9: Genetic Algorithms 2nd Half 

Some of this evolving code stuff seems like taking away the fun part. The feeling of how things work is the art. That said, if I had decided to code something I probably would have explored something starting from here:

- Food finder, poison avoider code https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/xgQNXkxx1
- from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnFF5V5DS8s&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bJM3VgzjNV5YxVxUwzALHV&index=19
- Repo with examples https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js/tree/master/chp09_ga
