Same as the code in springs, but the controller has been updated:

- loop starts and stops with "l" instead of UP_ARROW
- remove the need to have the runFlag in the draw loop
- to generate a recording burst on button press "r" if recording is enabled
- will save on "s" press if gallery mode is disabled.


### Instructions

Click on the disk and drag it around.

- "l" to start or stop the the running sketch
- "s" to save a single frame
- "r" to record a burst of frames.
