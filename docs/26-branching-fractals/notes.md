### Instructions

Most of these sketches use the DOM. They are best interacted with on their own pages.   

- The first two have a slider that controls the tree angles. On has to scroll down in the embed to get to them and they are hard to see on the black background.
- The third makes a new level every time the letter "t" is pressed until the branches are too short and then it adds "leaves." 
- The last has a "generate" button, also below the fold. On its own page the sketch spits out text into the HTML.
