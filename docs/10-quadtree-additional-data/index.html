    <H1>Day Ten: QuadTree Interlude Pt. 6</H1>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/carlynorama/2023January-30DaysNatureOfCode/tree/main/docs/10-quadtree-additional-data">Repo for Day 10</a></p>

    <p>So is it fair to keep calling it an interlude when its what you spent 60% of your time on? Last day of quadtree! First sketch recreates the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/CDMjU0GIK">Quadtree Tree part 3 video</a> (<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/CDMjU0GIK">code</a>) but trying to update and existing quadtree every frame instead of replacing it. Seems to work! That said, when I tried to add my mover back in to it and update the region only I am getting some glitches. If I really wanted a javascript quadtree now is the moment I would switch to TypeScript, really try to understand VSCode (which is also new to me) and rebuild it... only to realize its because I forgot a set of () at the end of a function call somewhere in the sketch! Ha! It's been super fun up to now, but if I keep pushing it won't be.</p>
    
    <p>Hover the mouse over the sketch to make it run. Second sketch semi-updates region based on mouse location.</p>
