One follower, multiple line segments. 

- Renamed the point-memory array trail instead of path to avoid confusion.
- Moved a bunch of the logic from `PathFollower` into `Path`. The path when given a point returns its closest location. 
- Implemented path radius check. 
- Implemented a bunch of path bounds checking that I'm not going to use yet.
