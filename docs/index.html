    <H1>January 2023: Nature of Code Playthrough</H1>
    <p>Time to shake the rust off. <a href="https://github.com/carlynorama/2023January-30DaysNatureOfCode/">See the Repo</a></p>

    <p>There is an official <a href="https://genuary.art">Genuary</a> process that involves lots of really cool prompts, etc, but I'm too rusty. What better way to get back into the creative coding groove than follow along with Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code 2 playlist?</p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="01-introduction">Day 1</a>: Introduction, Randomness, Videos 1-9, 16. Summary page has all the sketches from the day running. It can pull a lot of power.</li>
      <li><a href="02-vectors">Day 2</a>: Chapter 1, p5js Vectors, Videos 10-15. On the summary page the sketches only run if the mouse is over it. That is also true on the sketch pages, excpet on the last day I figured out how to tell if it was embedded or not.</li>
      <li><a href="03-forces">Day 3</a>: Part 1 of Chapter 2, force basics, Videos 17-19</li>
      <li><a href="04-forces">Day 4</a>: Part 2 of Chapter 2, Drag & Gravity, Videos 20-22</li>
      <li><a href="05-quadtree">Day 5</a>: QuadTree interlude. Mentioned in video 22. From a Coding Challenge.</li>
      <li><a href="06-quadtree-and-bounds">Day 6</a>: QuadTree clean up, with motion in the demo now. Also some bounds prep to keep going.</li>
      <li><a href="07-quadtree-query">Day 7</a>: QuadTree bounds query success!</li>
      <li><a href="08-quadtree-point-query">Day 8</a>: QuadTree query whether a point value is in the quadtree, access all the values within a radius of a point.</li>
      <li><a href="09-quadtree-update">Day 9</a>: Can remove points and regions of points from a quadtree.</li>
      <li><a href="10-quadtree-additional-data/">Day 10</a>: Made it to Video 3 look-alike. Found a glitch when I tried to add mover. Last stop on this line for now!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is going on in this Repo?</h2>
    <p>p5js is web embeddable focused, so why not build this as a website? Originally I served this website from the root of the main branch. I'd <code>cd</code> into the the directory that has this repo, type <code>python3 -m http.server</code> and browse away. Nice side effect, it was immediate available as a website.</p>
    <p>Over the past weeks I really really really was missing working in a strongly typed language so I decided to migrate to TypeScript. The bulk of the files now live in the docs folder, with JUST the <code>.ts</code> files living in the <code>src</code> folder. </p>
    <p>A nice side effect is that I can now use a local node server that constant watches for changed files so I'm not constantly hard refreshing the browser. The steps file, linked below, includes that.</p>>
